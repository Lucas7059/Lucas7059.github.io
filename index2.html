Hello World!
I attended Bradford Area High School and graduated in the class of 2023. I love playing video games with friends or watching sci fi movies.
I was born and raised in Bradford, PA. When I was young, I was diagnosed with severe migraines that would make me unable to focus when under flourecant lighting.
These migraines were so painful I'd have to stay in a dark room alone for several hours with medicine just to make them end.
Because of this, I was cyber schooled from grades 6-12. I joined this college for the oppertunity to not only improve myself, but also gain experience in the software engineering feild.
And thats my story, thanks for reading!
